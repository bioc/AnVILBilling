Description: AnVILBilling helps monitor AnVIL-related 
    costs in R, using queries to a BigQuery table to 
    which costs are exported daily.  Functions are defined
    to help categorize tasks and associated expenditures,
    and to visualize and explore expense profiles over time.
    This package will be expanded to help users estimate
    costs for specific task sets.
